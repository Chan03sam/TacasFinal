This is a web-based tool that provides an online platform for archiving the students' thesis or capstone projects. 

Our main objective is to help students, librarians, and future researchers preserve and archive various approved theses and capstones. Also, to provide students of Asia Technological School of Science and Arts an online access to a place where they can store their final year projects and to give lower year students a place to look for resources and ideas for a final year project they are working on right now or shortly.</span></span></font><br></p><p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span id="docs-internal-guid-5c94453b-7fff-8757-d382-201563ade4fb"><br></span></p>
